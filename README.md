### Please find some additional details when I was implementing the solution below

1. The page is fully responsive and some design ideas of the property cards came from the live website, such as logo design,
border radius, card shadow, etc.

2. The logo links provided in the original documents were not available and returned 404 results, so I searched the live website and found the closest agency logos by comparing the branding colours. In order to make the code clean and avoid hardcoding the new logos I found with the original ones, I updated the json file with new logo links.
